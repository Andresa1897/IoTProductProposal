# All-in-One IoT Solution for Evidence Security Protection System

In today's fast-paced world of the criminal justice system, safeguarding high-value evidence has never been more crucial. Leveraging the power of IoT (Internet of Things) technology, our all-in-one security system offers a comprehensive solution to protect evidence integrity, ensure consistent availability, and maintain accurate accountability. This project represents another sample of academic work, showcasing innovative approaches to real-world challenges within the field of technology and security.

## Overview

Our IoT-based security system is rooted in portable lockers that provide physical security both on-site and during the transfer of evidence to other locations. These lockers are equipped with smart sensors that offer real-time analytics, providing valuable insights into the usage patterns and proper storage conditions of the evidence stored within. Metrics such as weight, temperature, and humidity are monitored, allowing for immediate updates on the status of all evidence items.

## System Components

- **Portable Lockers:** These lockers form the foundation of the security system, offering physical protection for evidence items. Smart sensors within the lockers monitor various parameters to ensure proper storage conditions.

- **Base Stations:** Strategically placed throughout the facility, base stations serve as securing stations where evidence can be checked in, checked out, and prepared for transfer. Attached terminals automate the process of managing evidence, allowing authorized users to handle assignments efficiently.

- **Additional Sensors:** Various sensors placed within evidence rooms and forensic labs track movement, humidity levels, facial recognition, and the current location of lockers. Proximity sensors placed throughout the facility provide real-time updates on locker locations, enhancing security measures.

- **Cloud Applications:** The security system is integrated with cloud applications, enabling law enforcement personnel to access and analyze collected data remotely. Users can view graphs, logs, and current inventory from their mobile devices or computers, ensuring convenient and efficient evidence management.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Monitoring:** The system offers real-time monitoring of evidence storage conditions, including weight, temperature, and humidity, providing instant alerts for any discrepancies.

- **Automated Management:** Automation features streamline the process of checking evidence in and out, allowing authorized personnel to handle assignments and transfers efficiently.

- **Cloud-Based Access:** Cloud applications provide seamless access to system data, enabling users to monitor, analyze, and manage evidence from anywhere, at any time.

- **Enhanced Security:** Robust authentication measures are implemented within the cloud applications, ensuring that only authorized users can access different parts of the security system. These measures extend to physical access within the facility, enhancing overall security.
